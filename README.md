# Myshopping Website 

When you are starting your online business, you want to create an Business page that inspires people to shop with your company. But without knowing what to write on the page, you can waste time creating draft after draft without going anywhere. So we decided to simplify things a bit for you. We will look at some inspiring template to help.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy URL.

https://myshopping-app.vercel.app/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn react-scripts start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn react-scripts test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn react-scripts build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
